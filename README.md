# LU-KA DOT ME

Hi, and welcome to my website! 

## Development

All unminified files are in `unminified/` directory. All the pages are served as-is from `public/`. To work on the site, run `yarn install` and then run `gulp` to create a Gulp task watcher that will minify/concatinate the files from `unminified/` to where they need to be in `public/`
